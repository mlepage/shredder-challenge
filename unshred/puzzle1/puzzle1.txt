SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

Registered participants may submit their solution for each puzzle via the “Submit 
Solutions” tab on the Challenge website.  Registered participants are allowed to 
submit solutions for each puzzle as many times as they desire, but only the 
answers contained in their latest submission will receive a score.  For puzzles 
in which multiple answers are required, all answers must be submitted in the same 
upload.  Puzzle solutions may be submitted individually, in any order, and at any 
time prior to the deadline.  There is no requirement to submit solutions for all 
five puzzles.  There is no requirement to reconstruct documents completely, only 
reconstructed sufficiently to answer the required question(s).  
  
Submitted solutions must be in ZIP file format, no larger than 20MB, and 
contain the following: 

(1) Image(s) of the reconstructed document(s) in a common image format (TIF, JPG, 
etc); and 

(2) TXT file containing answers to the mandatory and additional questions.

All submitted files must be named using to the following convention: “puzzleX.ext” 
(e.g., puzzle1.zip, puzzle1.jpg, puzzle1.txt).  The website will automatically tag 
uploaded files with the registered participant’s identification and time of 
submission. The website will display confirmation of a successful file upload.

HOW TO ZIP A FILE:

Windows has a built-in zip capability so that you can compress files by using the
Compressed (zipped) Folder feature. Highlight one or more files to select them, 
right-click over a file, point to Send to (Send in XP) on the shortcut menu, and then
click Compressed (zipped) Folder.  

Mac OS X Finder can also compress files by creating a compressed archive. Highlight
one or more files to select them and choose Create Archive from the File menu.
